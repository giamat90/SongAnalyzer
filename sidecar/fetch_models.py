"""
Downloads the Demucs pretrained weights for the default-quality models
(htdemucs, htdemucs_6s) into vendor/demucs-models/, so build.py can bundle
them into the frozen sidecar. Without this, the installed app needs internet
access on first use to download ~140MB from Meta's servers into the user's
cache dir — the same class of bug as the ffmpeg-not-bundled issue.

htdemucs_ft (the "high quality" first-pass model) is NOT bundled here: it's
an additional 4x84MB on top of the above, only used when the user opts into
high_quality processing. It still downloads on demand for that path — a
known, narrower gap (see project_bundle_gaps memory).

Sigs/URLs are read from the installed demucs package itself (not hardcoded)
so this stays correct across demucs version bumps.

Safe to re-run — skips files that already exist.
Usage: python fetch_models.py
