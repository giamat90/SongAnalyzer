# Song Practice Studio — Claude Code Context

## What this project is

A Tauri v2 + React + TypeScript + Python desktop app.  
Drop any audio file (or paste a YouTube URL) → Demucs splits it into up to 6 instrument stems → multi-track player lets you listen, mute/solo/volume per stem, loop a region, slow down, click along to a phase-lockable metronome, zoom/pan the timeline (ctrl+wheel / shift+wheel), record yourself over the mix (with latency compensation), export a mixdown of the live mix, download each stem as WAV, or download everything (all stems + all recorded takes) at once as a zip via `export_all`.

Forked from **VPS** (`C:\Workspace\GiaMat90\MPS\VPS`), a vocal practice studio. The fork originally stripped all recording/analysis/coaching features; **recording was later reimplemented** for the multi-stem context (commit `a9f0806`, v0.0.7) with its own latency-compensation model. Pitch analysis and coaching remain VPS-only.

## Tech stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | React 19 + TypeScript (strict), Vite, Zustand |
| Desktop shell | Tauri v2 (Rust) |
| Audio rendering | WaveSurfer.js (one instance per stem) |
| Stem separation | Python sidecar via Demucs `htdemucs_6s` |
| IPC | JSON lines on stdin/stdout (Python ↔ Rust); `invoke()` (Rust ↔ TS) |

**Toolchain**: Rust 1.94.1, Node 24, Tauri v2. `cargo` requires PATH fix in bash — use PowerShell for Rust commands.

## Key architecture decisions

### Demucs model
`htdemucs_6s` — produces 6 stems: **vocals, drums, bass, guitar, piano, other**.  
Each is written as an individual `{name}.wav` in the song directory. Previous VPS used `htdemucs` (4 stems) and discarded non-vocal stems into a single `instrumental.wav`.

### Audio engine (`src/audio/engine.ts`)
Replaces the fixed `vocals`/`instrumental`/`take` WaveSurfer trio with a dynamic `Map<string, WaveSurfer>`.  
- First stem loaded (vocals if present) becomes the **master clock**.
- `interaction` events (user clicks only, not programmatic seeks) sync all other stems.
- rAF tick at 60fps; store notifications throttled to ~30fps.
- Loop logic lives in the tick: when `currentTime >= _loopEnd`, seeks to `_loopStart`.
- A recorded take loads as one extra instance via `loadTakeTrack(path, container, startOffset, audioOffset)`, aligned to song time with `_takeOffset`/`_takeAudioOffset` (same mapping as VPS: `fileTime = songTime - startOffset + audioOffset`).
- `setOutputDevice(deviceId)` re-routes every instance (and future ones) via `setSinkId`.

### Player store (`src/stores/player.ts`)
`stemVolumes: Record<string, number>` per-stem volume, `mutedStems: Record<string, boolean>` and `soloedStem: string | null` for the per-stem mute/solo buttons.  
Punch region state (`punchIn`, `punchOut`, `punchLoop`) is shared with the TimeRuler — same pattern as VPS.  
Recording state: `isRecording`, `isSavingTake`, `takes: Take[]`, `activeTakeId`, `takeVolume`, mic/output device selection, and `recordingOffsets: Record<string, CalibrationEntry>` (per-device latency calibration `{ offset, stale?, madMs? }`, localStorage-backed, with `usedLatencyFallback` set when recording starts without a usable calibration). Recording auto-stops when playback stops itself (punch-out or song end). No transpose state (VPS-only).  
Timeline zoom/pan state: `minPxPerSec` (zoom level, WaveSurfer's own px-per-second unit) and `scrollTime` (song time at the left edge of the visible window) — ctrl+wheel/shift+wheel over the stem timeline; see `wiki/audio-engine.md#timeline-zoompan`.  
`metronomeOffset` (song time (s) where the metronome's beat 1 lands, persisted per song via `set_metronome_offset`) — drag the downbeat marker on the TimeRuler, or "Set" to the current playhead, in `TempoControl`; see `wiki/components.md#tempocontrol`.

### Processing pipeline (`sidecar/processor.py`)
Five stages:
1. Demucs separation → writes `{name}.wav` for each requested stem, model chosen by a stem-count cascade (no guitar/piano → single `htdemucs`(`_ft`) pass; guitar or piano requested → `htdemucs`(`_ft`) on the full mix then `htdemucs_6s` on the resulting "other" stem) (progress 0→0.86)
2. BPM detection via `librosa.beat.tempo` on the original file — **no pitch extraction** (0.86)
3. Key detection via `chroma_cqt` on the first 60 seconds + Krumhansl-Kessler profiles (0.86→0.92)
4. Chord detection — chroma-template matching (24 major/minor triads, 1s hops) over the whole song → `chords.json`, non-fatal on failure (0.92→0.96)
5. Bass tab transcription — only if a `bass` stem was extracted → `bass_tab.json`, non-fatal on failure (0.96→1.0). **Backend-only**: no Rust command or frontend component reads it back yet on `master` (unlike chords — see below); a viewer exists only on the unmerged `feat/bass-tab` branch.

Returns `{ stems: {name: path}, duration, detectedBpm, detectedKey, chords, bassTab }` — `chords`/`bassTab` are booleans (file written or not); actual chord data is fetched separately via `read_song_chords(songId)` once `Song.hasChords` is true.

### Song data model
```typescript
interface Song {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  duration: number;
  detectedBpm?: number;
  detectedKey?: string;
  processedAt: string;
  directory: string;
  stems: StemName[];   // e.g. ["vocals","drums","bass","guitar","piano","other"]
  hasChords?: boolean; // true if chords.json was written — see read_song_chords
  folderId?: string | null; // library folder this song belongs to; null/absent = root
  sortIndex: number;        // rank among sibling songs sharing the same folderId
}

interface Folder {           // flat, user-named grouping of songs (e.g. all songs by one band)
  id: string;
  name: string;
  sortIndex: number;
}
```
Persisted in `~/.songpracticestudio/library.json` (top-level shape `{ folders: Folder[], songs: Song[] }`, with a legacy-raw-array fallback on read — see `wiki/data-model.md#storage-layout`); stem WAVs in `~/.songpracticestudio/library/{song_id}/` (managed by `src-tauri/src/storage.rs` + `library.rs`). Folder drag-and-drop (create/rename/delete/reorder folders, drag songs to reorder/move) lives in `LibraryPage.tsx` via `@dnd-kit` — see `wiki/components.md#library-folders-drag-and-drop`.

### Take data model
```typescript
interface Take {
  id: string;
  songId: string;
  recordedAt: string;
  filepath: string;       // RMS-normalized .wav (raw .webm only if normalization failed)
  name?: string;          // user-assigned; UI falls back to "Take N"
  startPosition: number;  // song time (s) where recording began; 0 = full-song
  audioOffset?: number;   // seconds into the file to skip (latency compensation overflow)
}
```
Persisted in `takes.json` inside the song directory; audio in `takes/{takeId}.wav`. At save time the Rust `save_take` command calls the sidecar `normalize_take` to RMS-match the take's loudness against `vocals.wav` (peak-capped).

## GUI rule

**All dimensions must use relative units** (`%`, `rem`, `vw`, `vh`, `fr`). Never fixed `px` for layout. This is inherited from VPS and must be followed strictly.

---

## Stem colors

Defined in `src/audio/engine.ts → STEM_COLORS`:

| Stem | Color |
|---|---|
| vocals | `rgba(74,158,255,0.85)` blue |
| drums | `rgba(180,80,220,0.85)` purple |
| bass | `rgba(60,200,100,0.85)` green |
| guitar | `rgba(255,140,30,0.85)` orange |
| piano | `rgba(255,220,50,0.85)` yellow |
| other | `rgba(160,160,160,0.85)` gray |

## Common tasks

**Set up dev environment (run once per terminal session):**
```
dev.bat
```
Opens a `cmd` shell with `cargo`, `node`, and the Python venv all on PATH. Required before any `cargo` or `npm run tauri` commands.

**Run in dev mode:**
```
npm run tauri dev
```

**Type-check only:**
```
npx tsc --noEmit
```

**Build for release (Windows):**
```powershell
# 1. Build the Python sidecar (first time or after sidecar changes)
cd sidecar
python build.py
copy dist\song-practice-studio-sidecar-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.exe ..\src-tauri\binaries\

# 2. Build the Tauri app
cd ..
npm run tauri build
```
Output: `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/msi/` and `nsis/` — both produce an installer named "Song Practice Studio".

> Bundle identifier `com.songpracticestudio.desktop` — use this for all platforms.

**Build sidecar only:**
```
cd sidecar && python build.py
```

**The sidecar is NOT auto-started by `beforeDevCommand`** — Tauri's `SidecarManager` spawns it lazily on first use (first song processed or YouTube import).

## Recording (reimplemented from the VPS concept, v0.0.7+)

Recording exists here — do not trust older docs claiming otherwise. Key points (full detail in `wiki/recording-flow.md`):

- `RecordButton` → `VocalRecorder` (`src/audio/recorder.ts`) with a Web Audio **channel-fix graph** (splits/max-merges input channels so 2-in interfaces that route the mic to one physical channel don't lose ~6 dB to a stereo→mono downmix).
- Per-device **latency calibration** (`RecordingOffsetControl.tsx`, click-clap wizard): `recordingOffsets` entries `{ offset, stale?, madMs? }` with devicechange staleness invalidation, MAD-based confidence chip, 0–500 ms and ≥5/8-onset sanity bounds. Unlike VPS there is **no per-recording output routing**, so no `outputDeviceId` on calibration entries.
- Recording **auto-stops** when playback stops itself (punch-out reached, or song end).
- Takes are **RMS-normalized** against `vocals.wav` at save time (sidecar `normalize_take`).
- Take plays back as an extra engine track aligned at `startPosition`/`audioOffset` (`TakeTrack.tsx`).

---

## What's NOT here (still VPS-only)

- Pitch analysis (PianoRoll, PianoKeyboard, DualTuner, analysis store, SRH sidecar)
- Coaching panel (CoachPanel)
- Key transpose (KeyTranspose, pitch_shift_song)
- Vibrato / timing / dynamics analysis cards
- Short-Term Spectrum / spectrogram panels
- Free Exercise mode (song-less recording)
- Instrument-only import (`kind: "instrument"`, skips separation)

If any of these are needed, refer to `C:\Workspace\GiaMat90\MPS\VPS` for the implementation — and check `MPS/wiki/feature-parity.md` first for porting notes.

---

## Known open work

- The `guitar` icon in `StemTrack.tsx` reuses 🎸 for both guitar and bass; could differentiate
- No waveform error UI per stem (only a top-level `stem-view__error` div)
- Bass tab transcription runs on every `process` call (`sidecar/processor.py`) and writes `bass_tab.json`, but no Rust command or frontend component reads it back — a viewer exists only on the unmerged `feat/bass-tab` branch (`ee54b89`)
